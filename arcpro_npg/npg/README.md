# Working with npg

**Tools and the Toolbox**

The toolbox ( ``npg_tools.tbx`` ) and the script ( ``tbx_toolx.py`` ) in this folder, plus the contents of the ``npg`` folder are used to define the Geo class and provide the ability work with geometry.
I will eventually get around to "packaging" it, but, just copy and retain the structure of the contents into a folder on your computer.  Load the toolbox into an ArcGIS Pro project from that location.
