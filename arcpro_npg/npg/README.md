**Tools and the Toolbox**

The toolbox ( \*.tbx ) file and the script contained in this folder, plus the contents of the Scripts folder are used for the Geo class.
I will eventually get around to "packaging" it, but, just copy and retain the structure of the contents into a folder on your computer.  Load the toolbox into an ArcGIS Pro project from that location.
