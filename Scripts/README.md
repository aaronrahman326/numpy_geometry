**fc_npGeo.py**

The methods used to convert esri geometries to an appropriate array format.
This script will require you have a valid license for ArcGIS Pro since esri FeatureClasses in a File Geodatabase need to be read and their arcpy geometries extracted and converted to numpy arrays.

Numpy is part of the distribution for ArcGIS Pro, so no other dependencies need to be made to their conda packages.
